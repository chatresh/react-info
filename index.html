<p>React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook.It is used to develop applications 
for Android, iOS, Web and UWP by enabling developers to use React along with native platform capabilities.</p>

<p>HISTORY</p>
</div>  
<div class="para">      
<p>In 2012 Mark Zuckerberg commented, "The biggest mistake we made as a company was betting too much on HTML as opposed to native".
 He promised that Facebook would soon deliver a better mobile experience.

<div class="para"> 
<p>Inside Facebook, Jordan Walke found a way to generate UI elements for iOS from a background JavaScript thread. 
They decided to organise an internal Hackathon to perfect this prototype in order to be able to build native apps with this technology.</p>
</div>
<div class="para"> 
<p>After months of development, Facebook released the first version for the React JavaScript Configuration in 2015. 
During a technical talk, Christopher Chedeau explained that Facebook was already using React Native in production for their Group App and their Ads Manager App.</p>

<p>IMPLEMENTATION</p>
</div>
<div class = "para4">
<p>The working principles of React Native are virtually identical to React except that React Native does not manipulate the DOM via the Virtual DOM.
It runs in a background process (which interprets the JavaScript written by the developers) directly on the end-device and communicates with the 
native platform via a serialisation, asynchronous and batched Bridge.</p>
</div>
<div class = "para4">
<p>React components wrap existing native code and interact with native APIs
 via React’s declarative UI paradigm and JavaScript. This enables native 
 app development for whole new teams of developers, and can let existing
  native teams work much faster.
</p>
</div>
<div class = "para4">
<p>
React Native does not use HTML or CSS. Instead, messages from the JavaScript 
thread are used to manipulate native views. React Native also allows developers to write native code 
in languages such as Java for Android and Objective-C or Swift for iOS
 which make it even more flexible.

<p>EXPO</p>

</div>
<div class= "img">
<p>Expo expands the API surface of React Native React Native does not give you all the JS APIs 
you need out of the box, but only most primitive features. React Native developers are expected to use Android Studio/XCode to link 
additional native libraries. Expo aims to enhanceRN and provide all the JS API 
you need for the most common needs.</p>


<a href = "#"><img src = "images/arrow.png" width = 350/></a>
<p>There are no tools to convert a "vanilla" react-native project to Expo. 
According to the docs : Right now, the easiest way to do this is to use expo init (with Expo CLI) to make a new project, and then copy over all your
 JavaScript source code from your existingproject, and then yarn adding 
 the library dependencies you have.</p>

Expo is a framework that is used to build React Native apps. It is basically a bundle with tools and services built for React Native, that will help you get started with building React Native apps with ease.
So there are two ways to build React Native apps. One using expo, and the other just using plain React Native, without Expo.</p>
